## 🌦️ Weather App 🌦️

This is a simple Weather App built as part of the Odin Project exercise. It fetch the weather data from an API (weatherapi.com) and display it to users, along with some basic styling using nested CSS.

# 🚀 What I learned:
- First time connecting to an API and handling asynchronous data
- Improved understanding of how to manage state and update the UI based on user input
- Started working with nested CSS

# 🛠️ Areas for Improvement:
- Load in weather info based on IP
- Save location in local storage
- Better layout on mobile
